# Delhi_Metro_Network_Analysis

Analyzing the metro network in a city like Delhi helps improve urban transportation infrastructure, leading to better city planning and enhanced commuter experiences. 
Below is the process I took for the task of Metro Network Analysis of Delhi:

1. Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.
2.Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules. Here, I collected the data from Kaggle.
3.Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
4. Created visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.
5.Analyzed how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.

Here, I used Python packages like Pandas , Numpy, Folium, Plotly.express, Plotly.subplots and Plotly.io
